# RecipeBox
Digitalization of one's "RecipeBox" as an Android Application

This was my first Android application ever written, and development was only during winter break during 2018-2019.
I also knew essentially nothing of the Java language prior to writing this application, so if you're one who's a competent in Java, please submit
suggestions on improving the Java source code.  It will be much appreciated!
Development will continue sometime summer 2019.

This is very much a rough draft of what will eventually be an app on the Google Play Store.

To run/upload this to an Android device, you'll likely need to do a fair bit of editing, however if you're looking for some descent examples of how
to use certain Android APIs (camera2 API for example), then there's definately some value to be gained in reading through the java source code.

Comments and suggestions are more than welcome, as one will likely see some glaring issues.
